            <h2>Embarking on a Transformative Journey</h2>
            <p>
                Starting my PhD at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics was a leap into the vast and intriguing world of observational cosmology. Under the guidance of Prof. Pravabati Chingangbam, I delved into the study of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), a crucial relic from the early universe. The initial excitement of beginning this journey was palpable, as I prepared to explore the fundamental aspects of the cosmos through data and analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                The early stages of my research were focused on understanding the statistical properties of the CMB. This involved meticulous work with observational data and the development of advanced techniques to enhance our comprehension of cosmic inflation and structure formation. The rigorous analysis and problem-solving required were both challenging and rewarding, setting the stage for significant discoveries.
            </p>
            <p>
                The vibrant academic environment at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics played a crucial role in my development as a researcher. Collaborating with fellow scientists and engaging in academic discussions provided valuable insights and fostered a deeper appreciation for the complexities of cosmological phenomena. The exposure to diverse perspectives and approaches enriched my research experience and academic growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Presenting my findings at various conferences and workshops was a highlight of my PhD journey. These opportunities allowed me to share my research with the broader scientific community, receive constructive feedback, and stay informed about the latest advancements in the field. The interactions with peers and experts from around the world were instrumental in refining my work and expanding my professional network.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reflecting on my PhD journey, I am deeply grateful for the mentorship of Prof. Pravabati Chingangbam and the support of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics. The skills and knowledge gained during this period have laid a strong foundation for my future research endeavors. The journey has been transformative, instilling in me a profound curiosity and passion for exploring the mysteries of the universe.
